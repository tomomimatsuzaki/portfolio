            <p>Feet First is a nonprofit organization that empowers communities throughout Washington State to create safe, healthy, and equitable public spaces for people walking and rolling. As Feet First was looking for ways to raise more awareness of the organization and its Advocacy work, I offered to create video storytelling using strategic storytelling methods that I learned at Georgetown University.</p>
